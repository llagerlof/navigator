## Required dependency

- **fzf** (fuzzy finder. Your distro probably has it available to install. If not, go to https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

## Optional dependencies (recommended for best experience)

- **xclip** (the current directory's path or last opened file's path is always copied to the clipboard)
- **xdg-open** (open the selected file with associated application)


## How to install

- Copy this script to `/usr/local/bin/`
- Make it executable with `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/navigator`

```
alias n="source /usr/local/bin/navigator"
```
- Reopen the shell to reload the aliases.

## How to use

- Run the script typing "n" in bash
- Navigate with arrow keys
