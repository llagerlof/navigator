# Navigator

Navigator is a script to allow fast and easy directory navigation.


## Features, tailored for best user experience

- The last created directories are near the focused cursor for quick access.
- Always focus on directory ".." when changing directory to allow quick exit to the parent directory.
- Files are listed separated from directories.
- Files can be opened with the associated application.
- Fuzzy search.

## Required dependency

- **fzf** - reason: fuzzy search (Your distro probably has it available to install. If not, go to https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)


## Optional dependencies (recommended for best experience)

- **xclip** - reason: While inside the Navigator the current directory's path or last opened file's path is always copied to the clipboard.
- **xdg-open** (package xdg-utils) - reason: Allow the Navigator to open the selected file with the associated application.
