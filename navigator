#
# navigator is a script to allow fast and easy directory navigation.
#
# Version: 1.0.0
# Author:  Lawrence Lagerlof <llagerlof@gmail.com>
# GitHub:  http://github.com/llagerlof/navigator
# License: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
#
# Required dependency:
#   - fzf (fuzzy finder. Your distro probably has it available to install. If not, go to https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
#
# Optional dependencies:
#   - xclip (the current directory's path or last opened file's path is always copied to the clipboard)
#   - xdg-open (open the selected file with associated application)
#
# How to install it:
#
#   - Copy this script to "/usr/local/bin/"
#
#   - Create an alias in your ~/.bashrc . Add the following line to the end of file:
#
#     alias n="source /usr/local/bin/navigator"
#
#   - Run the script typing "n" anywhere (you can choose another alias if you wish)
#
# Features tailored for best user experience:
#   - The last created directories are near the focused cursor for quick access the last created directories.
#   - Always focus on directory ".." when changing directory to allow quick exit to the parent directory.
#   - Files are listed separated from the directories.
#   - Files can be opened with the associated application.
#   - Fuzzy finder
